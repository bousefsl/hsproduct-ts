If you opt out, you'll need to contact us if you want to renew your cover for another year.</p>\n\n<p>Whichever option you choose, we'll send you a reminder around 4 weeks before your renewal date with the price of your cover for the next year, so you've got all the information you need to hand.\n\n<p>Just to note, opting out of auto renewal doesn't cancel your policy. If you decide your cover is no longer right for you, you'll need to <a href=\"/contact-us\">get in touch</a> to let us know.</p>",
